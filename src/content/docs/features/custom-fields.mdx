Custom fields is a feature which allows adding custom user data to any event in the rundown. \

This is an excellent way to have operator or department-specific data in your rundown (eg, light, sound, camera). \
It empowers collaboration and runtime with the [operator](/views/operator) and [cuesheet](/views/cuesheet) views.
