description: Use Ontime safely in your network
---

Ontime is designed with an open network approach, prioritizing ease of integration over access controls.

Ontime provides a basic level of protection for certain views such as [editor](/interface/production/app-editor), [cuesheet](/interface/production/cuesheet), and [operator](/interface/production/operator) through a **Pin Code** defined in the App Settings. \
However, it's important to note that any device within your network can send commands to Ontime, potentially altering its runtime. 
This is a deliberate design choice to facilitate integrations.

We discourage that Ontime is exposed in a public network. The most significant security controls would need to be implemented at the network access level. \
This approach allows Ontime to remain flexible and easy to integrate, while ensuring the security of your system is not compromised.
